### Hi there, I'm Abbas Shakiba ðŸ‘‹
I am a machine learning engineer at [Verisk](https://verisk.com). I love building ML pipelines in the cloud environment. My recent project was building an automated text mining app on AWS to analyze Verisk's sales call summaries in Python by leveraging NLTK and several AWS services like Lambda, CloudWatch, etc.

I am constantly in the process of learning. My interest areas are Python and programming in general, machine learning and ML Operations, and AWS services like Sagemaker, Lambda, CloudWatch, etc.
