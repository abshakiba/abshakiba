I am Abbas Shakiba, a Machine Learning Engineer with 8+ years of experience architecting, deploying, and scaling ML platformsâ€”particularly in payments and fraud. I specialize in MLOps and cloud-native solutions using Kubernetes and Kubeflow. At [Capital One](https://capitalone.com), I built fraud-detection systems that have prevented over \$100 million per month in credit-card losses and organized-fraud activities. As a core engineer on an ML team, I designed a high-scale pipeline and productionized predictive models that optimized credit-delinquency processes, saving \$1 billion by flagging high-risk customers and improving delinquency management.

I am fluent in Python, PyTorch, and PySpark, and skilled in advanced ML algorithms (LLMs, AGI, deep learning, etc.). I also have deep expertise in automation, CI/CD pipelines, distributed systems, and real-time model monitoring. I collaborate closely with data scientists, analysts, and engineers to take complex ML models from prototype to production in critical environments such as payments and fraud. Outside of work, youâ€™ll often find me running or perfecting my espresso shot.
